# README: 8 Queens Problem Solver

## Overview
This project implements a solution to the **8 Queens Problem**, a classic combinatorial puzzle where eight queens must be placed on a chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. The `8QUEENS.ipynb` notebook explores various methods to solve this problem programmatically.

## Features
- Visualization of the 8 Queens problem.
- Implementation of backtracking algorithm to find solutions.
- Option to display multiple valid solutions.
- Uses recursion and constraint satisfaction techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for programming.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding.
- **NumPy & Matplotlib** for computation and visualization.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 8QUEENS.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to initialize the chessboard and execute the algorithm.
3. Observe the visual representation of solutions.
4. Modify the board size to test N-Queens for different values of N.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement Genetic Algorithm or Simulated Annealing for optimized solutions.
- Extend the code to solve the **N-Queens problem** dynamically.
- Improve visualization with an interactive GUI.
